In 2022, The Healthcare industry has become the most imperative and vital for survival. With the pandemic surge, millions of people always look for easy and quick access to health information facilities. Inaccurate health-related misinformation may prevent people from seeking the care they need. So, it is important to provide people with a platform where all the myths about health can be resolved. Also, It is very well known that doctors always try to be available for their patients but sometimes it is impossible to cater to every patient due to their tight schedules. In these types of situations, an online platform could prove to be very helpful to people who want to clarify their doubts, get more information about different diseases and ailments and get instant suggestions related to their health problems.

The primary objective to tackle the problem is to provide the people with a platform where they can get answers to all their queries related to common health issues and their preventions. Nowadays, a lot of false information rapidly spreads on social media and elsewhere. So, it is necessary to provide people with a platform where they get the right information about different diseases. Thus, reliable information sources are crucial to prevent the spread of misinformation. For this I integrated a Chatbot that provides a single answer to most questions, they are able to present concise information from credible sources. Chatbots have varied widely in their responses to questions about physical health. In times of pandemic, chatbots can prove to be very helpful as patients can reach practitioners in their time of need. It also makes it easy for patients to access healthcare during emergencies, no matter where they are located. Chatbots also provide quick medical support to customers in times of emergency. It has a QnA set related to the different health-related queries. When a user asks a relevant query the chatbot responds with an appropriate answer.
